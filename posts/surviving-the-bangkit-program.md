When asked to sum up my Bangkit experience in one word, my answer is simple: resilience - the ability to persevere and adapt when everything seems to pile up all at once.

Imagine this: a collaborative initiative by Google, Indonesia's tech giants (Gojek, Tokopedia, Traveloka), and the Ministry of Education to create one of the most rigorous and transformative tech bootcamps. Participants dive into one of three specialized tracks: Cloud Computing, Machine Learning, or Mobile Development.

The program is no walk in the park. Between the never-ending assignments, attending meetings, Instructor-Led Training (ILT) sessions, and college exams, life felt like a juggling act on steroids. Coffee? It wasn’t just a beverage; it was my survival tool.

There were nights when I worked on assignments until 2 AM, knowing I had a college exam at 8 AM the next morning. There were days when I found myself attending Bangkit group meetings during class, trying to participate in discussions while secretly muting my mic so my lecturer wouldn’t notice. At times, I would review material for Bangkit during a quick lunch break, then shift my focus to preparing for a presentation in the next lecture.

One particularly chaotic week stands out: I had a midterm exam, a critical Bangkit group project deadline, and an important meeting with our mentor all in the same week. To keep up, I sacrificed sleep and powered through using the Pomodoro technique - 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5 minutes of rest (okay, maybe I stretched the rest to 10 minutes scrolling through TikTok).

Was I flawless in managing Bangkit and college? Absolutely not. But the goal was never perfection - it was persistence.

Choosing the Cloud Computing track turned out to be a wise decision. Thanks to my experience with backend development, topics like cloud services, databases, and APIs felt somewhat familiar. Even so, Bangkit’s fast-paced curriculum was still a challenge.

The real secret? Stealing time wherever I could. I worked on assignments during breaks between classes, brainstormed project ideas during lunch, and even reviewed documentation while waiting for lectures to begin. Sometimes, I’d catch myself working on Bangkit tasks in the middle of a lecture. Apologies to my professors - I promise I was multitasking for the greater good!

Despite my best efforts, there were moments when the workload felt overwhelming. I’d stare at the screen late at night, trying to make sense of an assignment I didn’t fully understand. It was during these moments that Bangkit’s mentorship system became my lifeline.

Each group was assigned a mentor, typically an experienced Bangkit alumnus who understood the struggles firsthand. My mentor specialized in Cloud Computing and was always ready to help. Their mantra? "Mentor itu harus kalian ‘ganggu’ terus” ("Don’t hesitate to reach out to your mentor frequently").

I remember messaging my mentor at odd hours with questions, hoping for some clarity. Their patience and encouragement were a reminder that even when things seemed impossible, I wasn’t alone in the journey.
From sleepless nights and chaotic schedules to moments of triumph, Bangkit taught me more than just technical skills. It taught me the importance of resilience, adaptability, and asking for help when needed.

Resilience is not about being perfect; it’s about showing up, trying your best, and finding creative ways to keep moving forward. Whether it meant sneaking in work during lectures, prioritizing tasks during busy weeks, or leaning on mentors for guidance, every decision was a step toward growth.

Bangkit is tough, but it’s also transformative. It’s more than a bootcamp - it’s a journey of self-discovery, personal growth, and yes, caffeine-fueled late nights.

To anyone in the program or considering joining: take it one day at a time, don’t hesitate to seek help, and remember to celebrate your progress - no matter how small. You’re doing better than you think, and every step forward is worth it.
