Before I start yapping about this, I want to make it clear that I am **not** a professional on anything related to these. This is just my personal opinion, my wild takes as a student living and learning in Indonesia.

This story began in 2022, my first year in college. Fresh out of high school, eager to learn, and optimistic about my future, I enrolled in a Computer Science program, excited about the opportunities ahead. I was ready to dive deep into algorithms, programming languages, and maybe even some cutting-edge technologies. Little did I know, the real world was moving at a pace I wasn’t prepared for.

## The Stale Curriculum Dillema

From day one, it became clear that something wasn’t right. The curriculum I was being taught seemed stuck in the past - a time when things moved slower, when technology evolved at a much gentler pace. We started with fundamentals, sure, but there was barely any mention of modern technologies like cloud computing, machine learning, or even the tools that are shaping the world today. I’m talking about services like AWS, GCP, or Kubernetes - things that the industry demands right now.

Instead, we were still diving into the basics of algorithms and theoretical concepts, which, don’t get me wrong, are important. But in the real world, what I needed was hands-on experience with tools that companies are using today. And guess what? That wasn’t covered in my classes. While I was learning about sorting algorithms, industries were building entire infrastructures around real-time data, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity threats.

Now let’s talk about PHP. Don’t get me wrong, I have nothing against PHP - it’s great for small projects and can still be powerful in certain cases. But when it comes to performance-critical applications, PHP is far from the best. And yet, in my university, PHP is still a core part of the curriculum. We’re taught PHP as if it’s still 2005. And then there’s Laravel 5. *Laravel 5?* That’s 10 years old! I don’t even know why we’re still wasting time on outdated frameworks when the industry has already moved on to newer, more robust solutions.

According to [research](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1281576.pdf?) from Indonesian Journal of Education, curriculum changes in Indonesia often fail to align with industry shifts, leaving students with outdated skills for the workforce.

## Inconsistent Programming Languages

Another issue I ran into was the inconsistency in the programming languages we were learning. On one hand, we’re taught PHP, but then we also dive into Java, C++, JavaScript, and Python. It’s a lot. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great to have exposure to different languages, but when you’re spread too thin, you never really master any of them. I’m left juggling five programming languages, but none of them have really sunk in because I didn’t have enough time to focus on just one.

In the industry, companies want experts - they want someone who’s mastered a language before moving on to another. But here I am, being taught languages from every angle, but never diving deep enough into any of them to truly master them. The real world requires depth, not just surface-level knowledge. And that’s where I felt my university education was falling short.

## Lack of Focus on Fundamentals

One of the things that bugged me the most was how we barely touched on the fundamentals that actually matter. Where was the focus on APIs, Git, HTTP, or even algorithms? Those are the building blocks of modern software development. Without a solid understanding of how these fundamental concepts work, how could we expect to handle more complex topics like cloud computing, big data, or machine learning?

We were skipping over core aspects of software development, all while diving deep into niche, highly specific topics. It was like we were trying to build a house without laying down a solid foundation. No wonder so many graduates are out there struggling to keep up with industry standards.

One might argue that these things take time to implement, but the reality is that the gap between university learning and industry demand is growing wider. [*The World Education News & Reviews*](https://wenr.wes.org/2019/03/education-in-indonesia-2) has highlighted that Indonesia's education system struggles to catch up with global trends, with an emphasis often placed on moral and character development rather than technical skills that match the evolving job market.

## The Human Resource Issue and Lack of Self-Awareness

Now, let me take a step back and reflect on something bigger. This isn’t all on the universities. Part of the problem is also with the students themselves. The reality is, some of us just don’t understand enough about how quickly the world is changing. Many students aren’t fully aware of the massive gap between what they’re being taught in the classroom and what the industry demands.

I’ve seen a lot of people in my program who seem uninterested, who don’t take things seriously, or who simply want to coast through without putting in the effort. The lack of self-awareness among students - the lack of a drive to improve, to learn on their own, to push beyond the confines of the university syllabus - is a huge part of the issue. There’s this idea that once you graduate, you’ll automatically be ready for the industry. But the truth is, you’re only ready when you take the initiative to learn and adapt on your own.

That’s why, in many cases, even if universities update their curriculum, it can’t help much if the students aren’t willing to put in the effort. Self-learning, staying curious, and developing a mindset of constant improvement are things that students need to take seriously - even if the system around them isn’t.

## The Need for Self-Learning

This disconnect really hit me when I started looking at job listings for internships and entry-level positions. Every role wanted experience with tools that weren’t even on my university radar. Instead of learning about DevOps pipelines or cloud services, I was stuck in the “old-school” approach, reading textbooks on systems theory that made me feel like I was studying for something that belonged to another era.

So here’s my take: don’t be too naive about what you’re learning in college. College is great for foundational knowledge, but it’s not going to prepare you for everything. You’ve got to take your learning into your own hands. Don’t wait for your university to catch up with the industry - take charge of your education, learn what’s relevant, and become the expert you need to be. There’s an endless amount of resources out there, from online courses to open-source projects, that can help you gain the practical, industry-ready skills that universities just aren’t providing.

Now, let me be clear - this isn’t the case for every university in Indonesia. I’m not saying all institutions are stuck in the past, and I understand that there are universities out there trying their best to keep up with the ever-changing tech landscape. But from my personal experience, and the experience of many others, this is the reality I’m facing. It’s not about throwing shade on the entire system, but simply pointing out that there’s room for improvement.

## How to Bridge the Gap

### For Curriculum Makers

1. **Update the Curriculum Regularly:** The tech industry moves quickly, so universities must stay on top of emerging trends and update their curriculums accordingly. This means integrating current tools like cloud computing (AWS, GCP), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and frameworks like React, Node.js, or even newer languages like Go and Rust. It’s not enough to teach outdated technologies; the curriculum needs to reflect what’s being used in the industry today.

2. **Incorporate Hands-On Learning:** Theory is essential, but practical experience is even more important. Universities should provide students with real-world scenarios through internships, live projects, and collaboration with industry players. This not only helps students gain experience but also builds their portfolio for future employers.

3. **Focus on Core Fundamentals:** While learning specific languages and frameworks is important, core concepts like algorithms, data structures, Git, HTTP protocols, APIs, and databases should be prioritized. These are the building blocks that every developer should know, regardless of the specific technologies they use later on.

4. **Industry Collaboration:** Universities need to build closer ties with the tech industry. By involving industry experts in the curriculum design process and offering internships, mentorships, and guest lectures, students can gain insights into real-world applications of their studies.

### For Students

1. **Take Ownership of Your Learning:** Don’t rely solely on the university to provide everything you need. The real world won’t wait for you to catch up, so take charge of your own education. Use platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or free resources on GitHub to learn new technologies. Contribute to open-source projects, attend meetups, or find a mentor who can guide you in the right direction.

2. **Master One Language:** Don’t try to master every language. Pick one language and get really good at it. Whether it’s Python, Go, or JavaScript, depth in one language will help you much more than spreading yourself too thin across many languages. Once you have mastered one, you can easily pick up others as needed.

3. **Build a Portfolio:** Employers want to see what you can actually do, not just what you know. Build projects, create a GitHub repository, and showcase your work. The best way to show you’re industry-ready is by actually working on industry-relevant projects and sharing them.

4. **Be Proactive in Gaining Experience:** Internships, freelance projects, or working on side projects will expose you to the real demands of the industry. Don’t wait for the university to provide it for you - go out there and create opportunities for yourself.

## Thoughts

The gap between university education and industry expectations is real. But this isn’t a hopeless situation. There’s plenty that both curriculum makers and students can do to bridge this gap. Universities need to adapt to the rapidly changing tech landscape, and students must take responsibility for their own learning. If both sides work together, we can ensure that the next generation of Indonesian tech talent isn’t left behind.

The world is moving fast, and the clock is ticking. Let’s catch up before we fall too far behind.
